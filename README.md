# vtx-power-on-a-switch

This project uses a circuit-python board ([Adafruit Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500)) wired to a Flight controller running Betaflight in order to enable vtx power control on a switch.

##Compatibility: 
*tested on a TBS Smart Audio (v2.1) Vtx
*tested on BetaFlight 4.1 

Should work on any servo-capable betaflight version
Should work on SA v 2.0 by only changing the power table (untested)

##Why this project:
I was surprised by the lack of interest on such a simple but game-changing feature [#3094](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/3094) from BF devs.
So i decided to extend my quadcopter capabilities on my own.
 
##How it works:
stay tuned!
